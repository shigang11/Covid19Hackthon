Covid-19 Hackthon

This project actually has 2 parts: (1) backend spring-boot project, (2) front-end Angular UI project. For now, you run them separately. 

First you start the backend to make the API's available for UI.

One thing, in order to run backend on your local, you have to install MongoDB first, which you can easily find online.

To run the backend, if you use Spring Tool Suite (STS), you don't have to deploy it to a server but simply right-click on the application, the select "Run As" and select "Spring Boot App".

To run the Angular UI, goto "ng-ui" folder, type "ng serve -o". A browser page will automatically open at this url: localhost:4200.

With the homepage open, you may click on "Add Customer" button first to add some customer records, then click on "List All Customers" button to display all the records you just added.

Bootstrap is used for CSS styling.
